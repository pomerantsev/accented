# Contributing

This document contains:

- A [Getting started](#getting-started) section that makes it easy to start developing.
- Assorted info for a developer that cannot be easily inferred from the codebase.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:**

- Node JS >= 23.6.0. Some of the modern Node features that we rely on:
  - The globbing in the native Node test runner is only supported in NodeJS 21+: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/50658#issuecomment-1806581766
  - The `suite` method in the test runner was added in Node 22: https://nodejs.org/api/test.html#suitename-options-fn
  - We use [type stripping](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run-natively),
    which is only available with no flags starting with Node 23.6.0.

**Installation:**

- Clone the repository.
- Install the PNPM package manager globally (`npm install -g pnpm`).
- Run `pnpm install`.

**Starting the development environment:**

- For Accented development: `pnpm dev`.
- For website development: `pnpm website:dev`.

**Running tests:**

- Unit tests: `pnpm test:unit`.
- End-to-end tests: `pnpm dev`, followed by `pnpm test:e2e` in a different terminal instance.

### Editor configuration

**TypeScript:**

Make sure your editor flags TypeScript issues — this ensures a fast feedback loop.

VS Code has built-in TypeScript support.

**Biome:**

Accented uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting most of the source files types, including TypeScript, CSS, JSON, and Astro.

You can configure your editor to format and fix lint errors on save. This makes sure you see linting and formatting issues before they make CI fail.

If you use VS Code:

- install the [Biome extension](https://biomejs.dev/reference/vscode/);
- create a .vscode/settings.json file in this repo (ignored by git) and copy the contents of [.vscode/settings.example.json](.vscode/settings.example.json) there.

If your editor doesn’t have a Biome integration or you prefer to not format on save, you have other options:

- invoke Biome manually via CLI (`pnpm biome check --fix`);
- use a [pre-commit hook](https://biomejs.dev/recipes/git-hooks/).

## Design / architecture

See the basics at https://accented.dev/how-it-works/.

### Browser support

In the [browser support policy](https://accented.dev/about#browser-support),
we decided to list specific browser versions,
as opposed to supporting a certain year’s [baseline](https://web.dev/baseline).

The reason is, the primary purpose here is to have a framework for deciding
whether to fix a specific bug in a specific browser version.

### Error handling

Global philosophy: rethrow all errors with as meaningful a message as possible.
If this is an unknown error, suggest a browser update.
In any case (except the most obvious ones, such as parameter validation), mention where to file issues.

Add a try-catch block in every code block that's called asynchronously, and cover as much of that block as possible.

All custom elements lifecycle methods need to be wrapped in try-catch (because they’re called asynchronously by the browser).

In the case of the Axe run failing, it's okay to swallow the error: if we rethrow it,
it will also be caught by the outer try-catch block.

If async code is simple enough and well tested (such as in task-queue.ts),
it may not need explicit error handling.

### Trigger placement in the DOM

**Decision:** Place the triggers next to their respective elements (as opposed to placing them all in one HTML element).

Pros:

- The primary reason is it seems to be impossible to have an interactive popover for some content in a modal dialog,
  where the popover lives outside the dialog.
  See https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9936.
  And I haven’t found a way to determine whether the element is within a modal dialog:
  it’s trivial to determine whether we’re within a dialog,
  but nothing to tell us whether it’s modal: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#htmldialogelement
  (I haven’t found any property for whether it’s modal, nor have I been able to check for inert on out-of-dialog elements).
- It’s trivial to maintain correct focus order this way, and there’s no need in a skip link.

Known issues:

- It may lead to invalid HTML in some cases
  (like when the element with an issue is an `li`, leading to the parent `ul` having non-`li` children).
- It may lead to toggling an element’s issue state,
  in case the issue is about an element not having text content,
  for example (the trigger adds text content because the button has an accessible name).

### Trigger positioning

**Decision 1:** use anchor positioning in supporting browsers.

Pros:

- Positioning requires much less JS code and is mostly handled by the browser.
- Better performance.

Known issues:

- We may not always be handling anchor-name property dynamic changes.
  We try to be the least disruptive, but I don’t think we can eliminate all possible issues.
- If positioning of the element with issues includes CSS transforms,
  anchor positioning doesn’t work as expected — it is so by design currently,
  so if this works better without anchor positioning,
  we may need to rethink our approach or give the consumer a way to opt out.
- Another challenge of anchor positioning has to do with testing in Playwright.
  Playwright doesn’t scroll the fixed-positioned anchored elements into view.
  And we can’t use `position: absolute` because it doesn’t work as expected on fixed-positioned triggers.

**Decision 2:** use fixed positioning (as opposed to absolute positioning)
as a fallback in browsers that don’t support anchor positioning.

Note: this choice may not be as important,
with anchor positioning hopefully coming to Safari and Firefox in 2025 / 2026.

Pros:

- Fixed positioning with updates on scroll may be the only way to support attaching triggers to elements that have `position: sticky`.
- Positioning is slightly easier than for elements with absolute positioning:
  We don’t need to find the position within the nearest scrollable container, just on the screen.

Known issues:

- Scroll jank.
- Scroll recomputations may become expensive if there are many elements with issues (although I haven’t noticed any performance degradation in testing).
- There’s additional overhead with ensuring that multiple scrolling regions on the page are taken care of.

### Shadow DOM styling

Setting `!important` styles on `:host` (particularly `all: initial !important`) seems to completely prevent
host app styles from leaking into the elements introduced by Accented.
That's even true for cases where the specificity of a host app selector is higher
(and the declaration has `!important` as well).

## Other decisions

- MIT license: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/ (simple and permissive)
- ESM, not CJS (at least, for now): https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/19ctbee/esm_cjs_or_both/ (folks say that for newer projects, it makes sense to go with ESM)
  - Sindre Sorhus does that for all his packages: https://github.com/sindresorhus/meta/discussions/15
  - I encountered at least one among styled-components.com’s dependencies: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-regex — and it builds well
- package-lock inclusion: should likely not be included in a library
- Distribution:
  - Latest-version JS, with TS type files alongside it (so the consumer can import the type if they want to)
  - NPM or CDN are both legitimate and supported cases (see https://accented.dev/getting-started/#install)
- Use PNPM instead of NPM: [I Finally Changed Package Managers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIKDJBrk56k)
- Stick with the main field for defining the package entry for now. Only change this if there is demand for legacy bundler support, I guess.
- Use Github Actions for all CI / CD needs (testing, building, publishing)
- Favicon generated with https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/ (the favicon.ico files contain the 16, 32, and 48 sizes — we are unlikely to need anything else).
  - Text: á
  - Font color: #ffffff
  - Background color:
    - #bb005e for the website (the closest RGB to the primary oklch(0.5 0.3 0), according to https://oklch.com/)
    - #005f87 for the devapp (the closest RGB to the focus color oklch(0.45 0.25 230), according to https://oklch.com/)
  - Background: rounded
  - Font family: Noto Sans
  - Font variant: Regular 400 Normal
  - Font size: 110

## Known issues / limitations

- In Safari, pinch-zoom leads to incorrectly positioned triggers.
  In Safari, top CSS prop doesn’t match what’s returned for the trigger element by getBoundingClientRect() when zoomed.
  See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207089
- In Firefox, when "Zoom text only" setting is on, zooming does not lead to trigger repositioning.
  I don't know if there's any event that fires when such zoom happens, so there may be no way to address it.

## Versioning and releasing

Public versioning policy: https://accented.dev/about/#versioning

We’re using [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to automate the version and release process of Accented as much as possible.

See [Versioning policy](https://accented.dev/about#versioning) when making versioning decisions.

### Marking a change that requires a version bump

When a code is being written / a pull request is being made, we should ask ourselves whether it may affect the consumers of Accented.
In other words, does this change deserve an entry in the changelog for the upcoming version?

If the above is true, run `pnpm changeset` and follow the interactive prompts.
This will create a file that describes the change and its severity according to [semver](https://semver.org/) (Patch, Minor, or Major).

The library version is **not** bumped at this time.

**Examples of changes requiring changesets:**

- A change in the business logic / UI / API (obviously).
- A bug fix / performance improvement.
- A dependency version bump.
  - For runtime dependencies, we’ll definitely bump the version, even if nothing is changing for consumers.
  - For build dependencies that may affect the generated code (for example, typescript), create a patch change.
  - For other development dependencies, don't add a changeset (this bump shouldn’t affect consumers at all).
- A development dependency version bump (if it may potentially change the compiled code).
- A Readme update (if that’s the Readme that gets published on NPM).

**Examples of changes that don’t require changesets:**

- A change in testing code.
- A change in the devapp.
- A CI config change.

There’s a bot provided by Changesets that comments on each pull request reminding that a changeset is expected along with the pull request.
Use your best judgment to decide whether it’s actually needed.

### Releasing a new version

This process is mostly automated.

There’s a pull request that’s kept up-to-date by a Changesets Github action,
and a human’s only job is to merge it when the time comes to release the next version.

**The pull request contains the following:**

- An Accented version bump, based on all the changesets on the main branch so far.
- A changelog update, also based on all the changesets.
- The removal of all the changesets (we start clean after a version bump).

**Merging the pull request performs the following actions:**

- Publishing the new version to NPM.
- Creating a tag and a release in Github that duplicates the changelog entry contents.

**Note:** Before merging, consider reformatting the changelog entries.
We’re using a default format provided by [@changesets/changelog-github](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@changesets/changelog-github),
however that’s not very flexible, and we’d like to replace it with a custom format moving forward.

### Releasing a snapshot version

We may choose to release a snapshot version for testing at any time.
This will **not** change the `latest` distribution tag on NPM,
and the version is `0.0.0-<timestamp>`,
therefore consumers will never install it accidentally.

To create a snapshot version, push a branch whose name starts with `snapshot`.
The CI server publishes a new snapshot release on every push to such a branch.

The version can then be installed by a consumer either by its version number (`accented@0.0.0-<timestamp>`)
or by the `snapshot` tag (`accented@snapshot`).
