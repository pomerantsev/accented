# Accented

<p class="subtitle">{description}.</p>

[Add a few lines of code](/getting-started#first-steps) to your web app,
and you’ll see interactive callouts appear next to elements with accessibility issues.

<p class="extra-space"><a class="call-to-action" style="display: inline-block; margin-block-end: var(--space-xs);" href="/getting-started">Get started with Accented →</a><br />
  or
  <a href={playgroundUrl}>try it out in the Playground</a>.</p>

An example of an application without Accented / with Accented:

<ImageCompare>
  <Image
    src={withoutAccented}
    alt="Screenshot of a web application without Accented."
    layout="full-width"
  />
  <Image
    src={withAccented}
    alt="Screenshot of the same application with Accented highlighting accessibility issues."
    layout="full-width"
  />
</ImageCompare>

## Features

- **Based on [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core),**
  the world’s most popular accessibility testing engine.
- **Instant and continuous feedback:** it highlights issues in the current state of the page you’re working on.
- **Initialized with just a few lines of code.**
  Everything lives in your project’s repo — no setup required in the browser or code editor.
- **Nicely complements other approaches to accessibility testing,**
  such as linting or using axe-core in your test suite.
- **Framework-agnostic:**
  it doesn’t matter what framework you use (React, Vue, Svelte, you name it) —
  or if you use one at all.
  As long as HTML ends up in the browser, Accented can help.
  It works equally well with server-rendered and client-rendered content.
- **Works on pages old and new.**
  Whether you're using the latest HTML and CSS features or maintaining a legacy codebase,
  Accented can help you find accessibility issues.
- **Free and [open-source](https://github.com/pomerantsev/accented)** (MIT license).
