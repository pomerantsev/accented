# API

<TableOfContents />

## Exports

- `accented`. The function that enables the continuous scanning and highlighting of accessibility issues
  on the page.
  Example: `const disable = accented(options)`.
  - Parameters: the only parameter (optional) is `options`. See [Options](#options).
  - Returns: a `disable` function that takes no parameters. When called, disables the scanning and highlighting,
    and cleans up any changes that Accented has made to the page.
    TODO: add link to a deeper dive that explains what changes may not be reverted (if any).

### Type exports

The following types are exported for TypeScript consumers:

- `AccentedOptions`: the `options` parameter (see [Options](#options)).
- `DisableAccented`: the type of the function returned by `accented`.

## Options

### `axeOptions`

**Type:** object.

**Default:** `{}`.

The `options` parameter for `axe.run()`.

Accented only supports two keys of the `options` object:

- `rules`;
- `runOnly`.

Both properties are optional, and both control which accessibility rules your page is tested against.

See [axe-core `options` documentation](https://www.deque.com/axe/core-documentation/api-documentation/#options-parameter).

### `callback`

**Type:** function.

**Default:** no-op (`() => {}`).

A function that will be called after each scan.

Potential uses:

- do something with the scan results,
  for example send them to a backend for storage and analysis;
- analyze Accented’s performance.

It accepts a single `params` object with the following properties:

- `elementsWithIssues`: the most up-to-date array of all elements with accessibility issues.
- `performance`: runtime performance of the last scan. An object with the following props:
  - `totalBlockingTime`: how long the main thread was blocked by Accented during the last scan, in milliseconds.
    It’s further divided into the `scan` and `domUpdate` phases.
  - `scan`: how long scanning (the execution of `axe.run()`) took, in milliseconds.
  - `domUpdate`: how long the DOM update (adding / removing outlines and dialog trigger buttons) took, in milliseconds.
- `scanContext`: nodes that got scanned. Either an array of nodes,
  or an object with `include` and `exclude` properties (if any nodes were excluded).

**Example:**

```js
accented({
  callback: ({ elementsWithIssues, performance, scanContext }) => {
    console.log("Elements with issues:", elementsWithIssues);
    console.log("Total blocking time:", performance.totalBlockingTime);
    console.log("Scan context:", scanContext);
  },
});
```

### `context`

**Type:** see details below.

**Default:** `document`.

The `context` parameter for `axe.run()`.

Determines what part(s) of the page to scan for accessibility issues.

Accepts a variety of shapes:

- a [`Node`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node) (in practice it will likely be an instance of [`Element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element), [`Document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document), or [`DocumentFragment`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment));
- a valid [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors);
- an object for selecting elements within shadow DOM,
  whose shape is `{ fromShadowDom: [selector1, selector2, ...] }`,
  where `selector1`, `selector2`, etc. select shadow hosts, and the last selector selects the actual context.
  `selector2` in this example is _within_ the shadow root created on the element(s) that match `selector1`,
  so in practice you shouldn’t have more than two elements in such an array
  unless you have a very complex structure with multiple shadow DOM layers;
- a [`NodeList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList) (likely a result of a [`querySelectorAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) call);
- an array containing any combination of selectors, nodes, or shadow DOM objects (described above);
- an object containing `include` and / or `exclude` properties.
  It’s useful if you’d like to exclude certain elements or parts of the page.
  The values for `include` and `exclude` can take any of the above shapes.
  It’s unlikely that you’d want to have complex `include` / `exclude` rules,
  but if you do, the exact behavior is documented by the relevant tests:
  [`is-node-in-scan-context.test.ts`](https://github.com/pomerantsev/accented/blob/main/packages/accented/src/utils/is-node-in-scan-context.test.ts).

See also the documentation for the [`context` parameter of `axe.run()`](https://www.deque.com/axe/core-documentation/api-documentation/#context-parameter),
which the `context` option from Accented mostly mirrors
(note that Accented doesn’t support the `fromFrames` object shape).

### `name`

**Type:** string.

**Default:** `"accented"`.

The character sequence that’s used in various elements, attributes and stylesheets that Accented adds to the page.

You shouldn’t have to provide this prop unless some of the names on your page have "accented" in it and conflict with what Accented provides by default.

- The data attribute that’s added to elements with issues (default: `data-accented`).
- The names of custom elements for the button and the dialog that get created for each element with issues
  (default: `accented-trigger`, `accented-dialog`).
- The CSS cascade layer containing page-wide Accented-specific styles (default: `accented`).
- The prefix for some of the CSS custom properties used by Accented (default: `--accented-`).
- The window property that’s used to prevent multiple axe-core scans from running simultaneously
  (default: `__accented_axe_running__`).

Only lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes (-) are allowed in the name,
and it must start with a lowercase letter.

**Example:**

```js
accented({
  name: "my-name",
});
```

With the above option provided, the attribute set on elements with issues will be `data-my-name`,
a custom element will be called `my-name-trigger`, and so on.

### `output`

An object controlling how the results of scans are presented.

#### `output.console`

**Type:** boolean.

**Default:** `true`.

Whether the list of elements with issues should be printed to the browser console whenever issues are added, removed, or changed.

### `throttle`

An object controlling at what moments Accented will run its scans.

#### `throttle.wait`

**Type:** number.

**Default:** 1000.

How long Accented must wait (in milliseconds) to run a scan after a mutation or after the previous scan (whichever finished last).

If the page you’re scanning has a lot of nodes,
scanning may take a noticeable time (~ a few hundred milliseconds),
during which time the main thread will be blocked most of the time.

You may want to experiment with this value if your page contents change frequently
or if it has JavaScript-based animations running on the main thread.

#### `throttle.leading`

**Type:** boolean.

**Default:** `true`.

If `leading` is set to `true`, the scan runs immediately after a mutation.
In this case, `wait` only applies to subsequent scans,
giving the page at least `wait` milliseconds between the end of the previous scan
and the beginning of the next one.

If `leading` is set to `false`, the wait applies to mutations as well,
delaying the output.
This may be useful if you’re expecting quick bursts of mutations on your page.

## Styling

You can control what some aspects of Accented UI look like
by setting the following props in your application (see [Styling](/getting-started#styling) in [Installation and usage](/getting-started) for a discussion of when you might need this):

- `--accented-primary-color`. The color of the outlines and of the trigger button background. Default: violet-red (`oklch(0.5 0.3 0)`).
- `--accented-secondary-color`. Trigger button text color. Default: white (`oklch(0.98 0 0)`).
- `--accented-outline-width`. Default: `2px`.
- `--accented-outline-style`. Default: `solid`.

**Note:** Accented’s default values are defined within `@layer accented`, so if you use the default layer to define your custom properties, they’re guaranteed to take precedence over the default ones.
[Learn more about CSS layers.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer)

**Note:** when using the [`name` option](#name),
the custom properties will start with that name, and the CSS layer will equal the name value.

For example, if `name: 'my-name'`, then the CSS custom properties will be `--my-name-primary-color`, `--my-name-secondary-color`, and so on,
and those will be defined within `@layer my-name`.
