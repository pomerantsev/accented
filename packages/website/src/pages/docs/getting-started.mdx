# Getting started

Here’s how to get started with Accented.

## Install

You have two main options for installing Accented.

- As an NPM module (if you’re using a bundler).
- From an ES module registry (no build step required).

### NPM

Install with NPM (or with another package manager, such as PNPM or Yarn).

```
npm install --save-dev accented
```

Then import the package.

```
import { accented } from 'accented';
```

### ES module registry

If you prefer to load Accented without a build step, consider using [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) as a CDN:

```
import { accented } from 'https://esm.sh/accented';
```

## Run in development mode

Run Accented in development only.

<div class="note">
  Never run Accented in production:

- It’s not your users who should be notified of accessibility issues, it’s you, the developer.
- Accented’s browser support policy (TODO: link) may be different from that of your application,
which may cause errors for some of your users.
</div>

Depending on your setup, checking whether the code is running in development or in production may look differently.

Additionally, consider importing Accented dynamically, to ensure that its code is not included in the production bundle.
