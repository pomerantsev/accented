# Privacy

This site collects a tiny amount of data from user visits.

None of the data is personally identifiable,
and the only purpose of collecting it is to analyze (and then potentially improve) site performance.

## What we collect, and how

For each page visit, the following is recorded:
- page URL,
- data about the browser extracted from the user-agent header (the full user-agent string is not stored):
  - browser name and version,
  - operating system name and version,
  - whether the visitor is a bot,
- [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) performance metric.

Only open-source libraries are used for data collection and analysis:
- [web-vitals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-vitals)
- [ua-parser-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js)
