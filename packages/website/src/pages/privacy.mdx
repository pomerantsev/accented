# Privacy policy

This site collects a tiny amount of data from user visits.

None of the data is personally identifiable,
and the only purpose of collecting it is to analyze (and then potentially improve) site performance.

## What we collect, and how

For each page visit, the following is recorded:
- page URL,
- browser name and version,
- operating system name and version,
- [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) performance metric,
- timestamp.

The data is collected using custom-written JavaScript (TODO: link to code),
and is stored in TODO.

## Contact info

In case of any questions, email Pavel at [hello@pavelpomerantsev.com](mailto:hello@pavelpomerantsev.com).

TODO: make a dedicated style for this.
