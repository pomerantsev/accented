# Getting started

Learn the basics of using Accented in your web application.

<TableOfContents />

## First steps

### Install

You have two main options for installing Accented.

- As an NPM module (if you’re using a bundler).
- From an ES module registry (no build step required).

**NPM:**

Install with NPM (or with another package manager, such as PNPM or Yarn).

```bash
npm install --save-dev accented
```

Then import the package.

```js
import { accented } from 'accented';
```

**ES module registry:**

If you prefer to load Accented without a build step, consider using [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) as a CDN:

```js
import { accented } from 'https://esm.sh/accented';
```

### Run in development mode

Run Accented in development only.

<div class="note">
  Never run Accented in production:

- It’s not your users who should be notified of accessibility issues, it’s you, the developer.
- Accented’s [browser support policy](/about#browser-support) may be different from that of your application,
which in turn may cause errors for some of your users on older browsers.
</div>

Depending on your setup, checking whether the code is running in development or in production may look differently.

Additionally, consider importing Accented dynamically, to ensure that its code is not included in the production bundle.

### Starter code

You can use the following code as a starting point.

<StarterCode />

### Run once per page

Accented should only be initialized once per page.
It uses `axe.run()` under the hood,
which throws an error if called multiple times simultaneously.

If `accented()` may be called multiple times (for example,
in a component by a framework that supports hot reloading),
make sure to disable Accented when the component is unmounted.

```js
/* Initialize on component mount */
const disable = accented();

...

/* Disable on component unmount */
disable();
```

## Using in large projects

Introducing Accented to a large codebase may present an organizational challenge.

Similar to introducing linting, if initialized with no options (`accented();`),
the output may be overwhelming, with dozens of issues reported per page.

To avoid this, introduce Accented gradually, with a combination of the following:

- **Use the [`context` option](/api#context) to limit scans to certain parts of the page.**
  For example, you can start by scanning only certain components,
  and then gradually expand the context to include more components.
- **Use the [`axeOptions` option](/api#axeoptions) to include or exclude some axe rules.**
  This can be useful if your app has many instances of a certain type of issue.
  By initially excluding the rule for that issue,
  you can make the output more manageable.

In the future, Accented may have a console-only mode
(see [issue #28](https://github.com/pomerantsev/accented/issues/28)),
which would also make it easier to introduce Accented.

## Using with frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.)

Accented is fully framework-agnostic.
It uses a mutation observer to detect changes in the DOM,
and it doesn’t matter what causes those changes
or how your application’s codebase is structured.

That said, when using a framework, you have options:

- **Call once during initialization (the simple option).**
  Call `accented()` at any point during your app’s initialization. That’s it.
- **Create a reusable component.**
  Consider it if you need to scan different parts on different pages.
  Here’s what such a component may look like in React:
```jsx
import { accented } from 'accented';
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

// This component should only be used once per page.
export function Accented({ children }) {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!containerRef.current) {
      /**
       * containerRef.current is going to be null if we’re not in development mode,
       * given what the component returns.
       */
      return;
    }

    const disable = accented({
      // Initialize Accented only for the descendants of this element.
      context: containerRef.current,
    });

    return () => {
      /**
       * It’s important to clean up when component is unmounted.
       * If we don’t, Accented may be initialized more than once,
       * potentially leading to unpredictable behavior.
       * See https://www.accented.dev/getting-started#run-once-per-page
       */
      disable();
    };
  }, []);

  /**
   * How `isDevelopment` is calculated depends on your setup.
   * See https://www.accented.dev/getting-started#run-in-development-mode
   */
  if (isDevelopment) {
    return (
      <div ref={containerRef}>
        {children}
      </div>
    );
  }

  return children;
}
```

## Using in CI (continuous integration)

Accented is only meant for local development.
It runs accessibility tests on the page
that’s currently in the developer’s browser.

However, if you additionally need something similar for CI,
consider using [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) in your automated test suite,
either directly, or through wrappers such as [jest-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe)
or [axe-playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-playwright)
(depending on your test framework).

## Improving performance

Accented _may_ [negatively affect the performance](/how-it-works#performance) of your application in development,
however there are ways to make performance issues less perceptible.

### Confirm that the issues are caused by Accented

The following may indicate that Accented takes too long to run:

- The page becomes slower to respond to user input.
- Animations become choppy.

To verify that the cause of these issues is indeed Accented,
and not something else in your application,
you can use the [`callback` option](/api#callback):

```js
accented({
  callback: ({ performance }) => {
    const { totalBlockingTime, scan, domUpdate } = performance;
    console.log(
      `Accented run took ${totalBlockingTime}ms (scan: ${scan}ms, DOM update: ${domUpdate}ms)`
    );
  },
});
```

If `totalBlockingTime` is low (less than 100 ms),
then Accented is probably not the cause of the performance issues.

If it’s high (a few hundred milliseconds),
try [changing run frequency (using `throttle`)](#change-run-frequency)
or [disabling some axe rules (using `axeOptions`)](#disable-some-axe-rules).

### Change run frequency

Use the [`throttle` option](/api#throttle)
to control the minimal timeout between consecutive scans
and whether there should be a timeout between a mutation and a scan.

For example, if your page has lots of elements,
and user interactions are followed by JS-driven animations,
consider offsetting the scan by the duration of the animation:
```js
accented({
  throttle: {
    wait: 500, // wait 500 ms to let animations finish
    leading: false // don’t run the scan immediately after a mutation
  }
});
```

By changing `wait` and `leading` values,
you can find a balance between Accented responsiveness and app performance.

### Disable some axe rules

If you find that even with a high `wait` value,
Accented still takes too long to run,
consider disabling some axe rules.

You can do so if you don’t expect some types of issues to arise.

For example, if you know you have a color scheme with high enough contrast,
you may get a noticeable performance boost by disabling the [`color-contrast` rule](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/color-contrast)
which is expensive to test for:
```js
accented({
  axeOptions: {
    rules: {
      'color-contrast': { enabled: false }
    }
  }
});
```

See [`axeOptions` documentation](/api#axeoptions) for more details.

## Styling

You can change some styling aspects of the elements that are added by Accented.
It’s usually desirable to make such elements stand out on the page,
so consider doing it if the defaults don’t provide enough contrast in your application.

You can make the changes by setting certain CSS properties in your app, for example:

```css
:root {
  --accented-primary-color: darkgreen;
  --accented-outline-width: 3px;
  --accented-outline-style: dashed;
}
```

Here’s what the updated styles would look like compared to the defaults:

<ImageCompare>
  <Image
    src={screenshotDefaultColor}
    alt="Screenshot of a web application, with highlights by Accented, having regular styles."
    layout="full-width"
  />
  <Image
    src={screenshotGreen}
    alt="Screenshot of the same web application, also with highlights by Accented. The highlights are dark green instead of violet red, and the outlines are dashed instead of solid."
    layout="full-width"
  />
</ImageCompare>

See full CSS API in the [Styling section](/api#styling) of the [API docs](/api).

## Using Accented with iframes

Accented doesn’t scan iframe contents.

If you wish to scan the document that’s rendered inside an iframe,
and you have control over that document,
initialize Accented in that document.

There will be no interference between the instances of Accented
running in the parent and child documents.

If you don’t control the child document,
you won’t be able to run Accented there,
and it wouldn’t be helpful anyway
(because without controlling the document’s source,
you wouldn’t be able to fix whatever issues Accented finds).
