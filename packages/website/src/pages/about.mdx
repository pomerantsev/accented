## Accessibility

Accented adds its own UI elements to the host application.
For each element with accessibility issues,
it inserts a button that opens a dialog describing the issue.

We aim to make those elements as accessible as possible.

- They can be navigated using only the keyboard.
- They use appropriate semantic HTML.
- Interactive elements, such as links and buttons, have meaningful accessible names.
- The language of Accented’s UI (currently English) is correctly specified for assistive technologies.
- Color combinations have sufficient contrast.
- Interactive elements are large enough for touch navigation,
  and all content remains accessible without relying on hover.
- Content can be resized without requiring horizontal scrolling.
- Font sizes scale with browser settings (defined using `em` / `rem` units).

Accented follows [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) level AA as a baseline,
and going beyond it by incorporating best practices and community feedback.

If you encounter an accessibility issue within Accented itself or have suggestions,
please open [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pomerantsev/accented/issues)
or contact the maintainer directly at [hello@pavelpomerantsev.com](mailto:hello@pavelpomerantsev.com).

## Browser support

Accented supports the **two latest major versions** of **Chrome, Safari,** and **Firefox.**

**Safari** is the only major browser where minor versions significantly differ in Web Platform support.
Within each supported major version, Accented supports the two latest minor versions.
For example, if 18.5 is the latest version, Accented will support 17.5, 17.6, 18.4, and 18.5.

Before each release, Accented’s [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
test suite runs in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

Maintainers may remove fallback code for modern browser features
once those features are fully supported in all supported browsers.
We assume that most developers keep their development browsers up to date.
However, when browser updates are tied to OS updates (as with Safari),
staying current may be harder.
That’s why we support Safari versions that may be over a year old.

## Versioning

Accented follows [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).

In practice, here’s how we decide whether a release should be major, minor, or patch.

**Major:**

- A breaking API change.

**Minor:**

- A non-breaking (additive) API change.
- A behavioral change that isn’t a bug fix (for example, when Accented starts reporting a new class of issues).

**Patch:**

- A bug fix.
- A performance improvement.
- A non-breaking UI improvement.
- A runtime dependency update that isn’t supposed to change behavior.
- A build-time dependency update that may affect the build output (for example, a TypeScript version upgrade).
- A README fix that’s visible on the NPM package page.

**No version change:**

- Dev/test-only dependency updates (for example, JSDOM).
