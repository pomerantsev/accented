## Accessibility

Accented adds its own user interface elements to a host application:
for each element with accessibility issues within the host application,
it adds a button which opens a dialog with issue descriptions.

We strive to make those elements as accessible as possible.

- Elements added by Accented are easy to navigate with keyboard only.
- Elements have logical semantic structures.
- Interactive elements (including links and buttons) have meaningful names.
- Language of elements (currently only English) is properly specified.
- Color combinations have sufficient contrast.
- Interactive elements are large enough for touch navigation,
  and no content is presented only on hover.
- Content can be resized without requiring horizontal scrolling.
- Browser font size settings are respected (all font sizes are defined in `em` / `rem` units).

We take accessibility seriously, using [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) (level AA) as the baseline
and going beyond it to follow relevant best practices and community feedback.

If you encounter an accessibility issue within Accented itself or have suggestions,
please open [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pomerantsev/accented/issues)
or contact Pavel directly at [hello@pavelpomerantsev.com](mailto:hello@pavelpomerantsev.com).

## Browser support

Accented aims to support the **2 latest major versions** of **Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.**

Specifically for **Safari** (the only major browser in which minor versions differ in the level of Web Platform feature support),
**2 latest minor versions** will be supported **within each supported major version.**
For example, if 18.5 is the latest version, Accented will support 17.5, 17.6, 18.4, and 18.5.

Accented has a suite of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) tests that run in the latest Chrome, Safari, and Firefox before a new version of the library is published.

Accented maintainers may explicitly choose to remove fallback code for a modern browser feature as soon as all supported browsers support such a feature.
We assume that most developers keep their development browsers up to date.
At the same time, if the major browser version is tied to the OS version (as is the case with Safari),
staying up to date may be more challenging,
hence the necessity to support a browser that may be more than a year old.

## Versioning

Accented strives to adhere to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

In practice, here’s how we decide whether to make a major, minor, or patch version bump.

**Major:**

- A breaking API change.

**Minor:**

- A non-breaking (additive) API change.
- A change in behavior that’s not a bug fix (for example, when Accented starts reporting a new class of issues).

**Patch:**

- A bug fix.
- A performance improvement.
- A UI improvement.
- A runtime or build-time dependency bump (presuming that an upgrade of a build-time dependency, such as TypeScript, may affect the code that’s surfaced to consumers).
- A fix in the Readme that's published on NPM.

**No version change:**

- Bumping a dependency that only affects the development or testing workflow (for example, JSDOM).
