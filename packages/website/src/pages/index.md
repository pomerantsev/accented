# Accented

Continuous accessibility testing and issue highlighting for web development.

TODO: visual demo.

Accented helps you spot accessibility issues as they’re introduced in code.

TODO: this list could be more visual.

- It’s based on [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core),
  the world’s most popular accessibility testing engine.
- It gives instant and continuous feedback: it highlights issues in the current state of the web page that you’re working on.
- It’s just a few lines of code in your repo. Zero setup is required in the browser or code editor, so the output for all contributors is guaranteed to be the same.
- It complements (TODO: add link to a deeper dive) approaches such as audits in Lighthouse or browser extensions,
  linting, or using axe-core in your test suite.
- It’s framework-agnostic: it doesn’t matter if you use React, Vue, Svelte, or Vanilla JavaScript.
  Likewise, your content can be rendered on the server or on the client.
  As long as you display HTML on a web page, your project can benefit from Accented.
- It’s free and [open-source](https://github.com/pomerantsev/accented) (MIT license).
