and you’ll see interactive callouts next to the elements containing accessibility issues.

## Features

- **Based on [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core),**
  the world’s most popular accessibility testing engine.
- **Instant and continuous feedback:** it highlights issues in the current state of the web page that you’re working on.
- **Initialized with just a few lines of code.**
  It’s all in your project’s repo.
  Zero setup is required in the browser or code editor.
- **Nicely complements other approaches to accessibility testing,**
  such as linting or using axe-core in your test suite.
- **Framework-agnostic:**
  it doesn’t matter if you use React, Vue, Svelte, or Vanilla JavaScript.
  Likewise, your content can be rendered on the server or on the client.
  As long as you display HTML on a web page, your project can benefit from Accented.
- **Works on pages old and new.**
  You may be using the latest HTML and CSS features in your project,
  or maintaining a legacy codebase, Accented can still help you find accessibility issues.
- **Free and [open-source](https://github.com/pomerantsev/accented)** (MIT license).
