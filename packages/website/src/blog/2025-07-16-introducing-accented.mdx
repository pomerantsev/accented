title: Introducing Accented
description: Accented helps you catch accessibility issues on your page the moment they appear — no need to run audits using browser extensions. It integrates seamlessly into your dev flow with just a few lines of code.

import ImageCompare from '~/components/ImageCompare.astro';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import withoutAccented from '~/assets/images/without-accented.png';
import withAccented from '~/assets/images/with-accented.png';
import dialogImage from '~/assets/images/dialog.png';

Here’s what Accented is about.

You add a bit of code to your web app, for example:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  const { accented } = await import('accented');
  accented();
}
```

That’s all the setup you need to get real-time accessibility auditing
of the page that’s rendered in your browser,
using [axe-core®](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core),
the most popular accessibility testing engine.

Each element with at least one accessibility issue gets highlighted.

<ImageCompare>
  <Image
    src={withoutAccented}
    alt="Screenshot of a web application without Accented."
    layout="full-width"
  />
  <Image
    src={withAccented}
    alt="Screenshot of the same application with Accented highlighting accessibility issues."
    layout="full-width"
  />
</ImageCompare>

Clicking one of the added buttons
shows enough information to understand what the issue is and how to fix it.

<Image
  src={dialogImage}
  alt="Screenshot of the same application with an open dialog displaying accessibility issue information."
  layout="full-width"
/>

The issues are updated when page contents or styles change
(Accented uses a [mutation observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) to detect changes),
which is common in apps of all kinds —
from mostly static pages to full-blown single-page apps (SPAs).

## Accessibility testing tools: an overview

To see where Accented fits in a dev workflow,
let’s take a look at the landscape of available accessibility testing tools.

**Disclaimer:** I’m only reviewing automated approaches here.
Many types of issues may only be correctly identified by a human,
so none of these tools are intended to replace manual audits.

All the tools fall into two broad categories:

- **The ones that audit the source code.**
- **The ones that audit the rendered page.**

I will leave AI-based tools out of the conversation.
They can potentially identify more issues than the algorithmic approaches
(they can sometimes even catch what human auditors may miss),
but they’re not free and are by nature unreliable.
They’re simply an entirely different category of tools.

### Source-code-based tools

These tools operate on a limited test surface —
there’s a finite amount of source code in any project.

The downside is that they’re limited in the types of issues they can detect.

For example, they can help with missing alt attributes
or inputs not having correctly associated labels.

They won’t tell you if your headings are in an incorrect order —
that requires a rendered page to test.

The most widely used tool in this category is [**eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y),
which is a plugin for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

As its name suggests, if you author your app using JSX,
it checks your whole codebase against a set of accessibility rules.

It’s great as the first line of defense, it’s very easy to set up,
and it requires virtually no maintenance.


### Rendered-page-based tools

Such tools can never test all the surfaces: even in the simplest cases,
the page may be presented to the user in a multitude of ways,
depending on their device, OS, browser, preferences, and so on,
and with every new input, the number of possibilities grows exponentially.

The potential to be able to correctly identify issues is also higher because,
unlike with the source code,
your test script actually perceives the page the way your user may perceive it.

Most tools in this category are based on [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core),
and can detect [a wide range of accessibility concerns](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/8dca2ac1d291269acece20da4b142629be0f88a7/doc/rule-descriptions.md),
such as contrast issues, heading structure problems, and list semantics.

- **Accented** belongs to this category.
  It costs very little to set up and maintain,
  it catches issues in real time (similar to linters),
  and it’s completely framework-agnostic.
- There are **on-demand auditing tools**, such as browser extensions or [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse).
  Their major downside is that such audits are not triggered automatically —
  running them requires developer involvement.
- The [**Astro framework**](https://astro.build/) (and possibly others too)
  has an [**accessibility auditing tool**](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/dev-toolbar/#audit) built into their dev toolbar,
  and its output is similar to what Accented provides (overlays and hints on the page).
  Showing the overlays, however, also requires an explicit action,
  reducing the impact of the tool.
- Accessibility testing can be performed in **automated test suites**.
  Such tests can be valuable, as they prevent accessibility regressions.
  We have to keep in mind, however, that testing is a high-friction approach:
  every test needs to be written and maintained.
- There’s also **[@axe-core/react](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/blob/b374159a9e63c4dad0135fb2353163ffe8c04453/packages/react/README.md)**,
  which is very similar in spirit to Accented.
  It also scans the rendered page and outputs scan results (only to the console).
  Unfortunately, it’s only meant for React applications, it doesn’t support modern versions of React,
  and overall it’s in maintenance mode, with no further development plans.

### Comparison

Here’s a summary to help you choose the right tools.

- **Linting.**
  - **Pros:** checks the whole codebase in real time, easy to set up, can be used in CI.
  - **Cons:** tests only code, JSX-specific.
- **Accented.**
  - **Pros:** tests current page in real time, easy to set up, framework-agnostic.
  - **Cons:** [modifies the page](#page-modifications), [may impact runtime performance](#runtime-performance).
- **Browser devtools (axe, Lighthouse).**
  - **Pros:** zero setup required.
  - **Cons:** requires an explicit action to run the audit.
- **Framework devtools.**
  - **Pros:** zero setup required.
  - **Cons:** framework-specific by definition, may require an explicit action to run the audit.
- **Tests ([jest-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe), [@axe-core/playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/playwright), etc.).**
  - **Pros:** prevent regressions, can be used in CI.
  - **Cons:** high cost (tests need to be written and maintained).

Overall, I think of Accented as an additional safety net
that can further strengthen the accessibility posture of your application,
even if it’s already relying on a few other tools.
And it does so at very low cost
(just a few lines added to your codebase, as demonstrated earlier).

## Success stories

The benefits are not purely theoretical.

Accented just launched, but I’m already seeing real results.

### accented.dev

I used Accented while developing this website (dogfooding, you know).

I literally [set it up](https://github.com/pomerantsev/accented/blob/26d2d45b7009198b6dfc0c42c0854ef805d3380a/packages/website/src/components/Accented.astro#L2-L3)
and forgot about it.

Then one day it flagged a contrast issue in the code blocks,
which I was able to quickly fix by [choosing a different theme](https://github.com/pomerantsev/accented/blob/26d2d45b7009198b6dfc0c42c0854ef805d3380a/packages/website/astro.config.mjs#L17).

I don’t know of any other tool that would help me catch this issue
automatically (without me explicitly running an audit on a specific page),
and with almost no setup.

### squarespace.com

From 2021 to 2024, I led accessibility engineering at Squarespace,
and our team built an internal library that was the predecessor to Accented.

That library was used by the developers of
Squarespace’s main user-facing website ([squarespace.com](https://squarespace.com)),
and I’m happy to report that most marketing pages on the website still have very few issues
at the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) 2.1 AA level that axe-core can detect.

You can verify it yourself with a tool like
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse)
or the [axe DevTools extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd).

## Common concerns

Accented is easy to set up, and its maintenance cost is negligible.

That said, developers may have legitimate concerns.

### Page modifications

Accented modifies the DOM of the host application:
it adds stylesheets, attributes, and elements.

It strives to minimize the impact:
for instance, it uses shadow DOM to isolate the styles.

Still, some changes are unavoidable,
so whenever there’s an accessibility issue on the page,
there is a also chance that when Accented makes its modifications,
something else on the page changes as well.

For example, if your JavaScript assumes a specific number of child elements, or if styles rely on sibling selectors, Accented’s DOM changes might interfere.

Fortunately, **as soon as the underlying accessibility issue is fixed**
(which is the whole point of using Accented),
the changes will be reverted, and **the page will return to its original state.**

### Noisy output

If you’re installing Accented in an existing app,
it may flag many issues at once,
potentially overwhelming the developer with its output.

On one hand, those are all legitimate issues that need to be addressed.

On the other, we want things to be manageable,
and the strategy here is to use [`axeOptions`](/api#axeoptions)
and [`context`](/api#context)
to start small and then gradually expand the scope of the tests
(see [Using in large projects](/getting-started#using-in-large-projects)).

### Runtime performance

Accented runs axe-core in the browser,
and that may be an expensive operation (especially on large, complex pages).

Accented [runs the minimum necessary axe-core tests](/how-it-works#performance) to ensure accurate output,
but in some cases the slowdown to the host application may still be noticeable.

The developers can further mitigate the impact
by using [the performance-focused APIs](/getting-started#improving-performance).

### Bundle size

Accented should have zero impact on the production bundle size
because it’s [only supposed to be used in development](/getting-started#run-in-development-mode).

All modern bundlers support [tree shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking),
so Accented will be fully removed in production builds.

## In closing

I believe that any web project can benefit from using Accented,
no matter if it’s in early development or already live and evolving.

No matter which framework you use or how deep your accessibility knowledge is,
this tool can help your users have a smoother experience with your application.
