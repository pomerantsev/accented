title: "Developing Accented: anchor positioning"

In this post, I'll talk about:
- the positioning challenges of Accented.
- how anchor positioning solves those challenges.
- what's the fallback for non-supporting browsers.
  - tell more about Safari, how it works, but not really.

## The positioning challenge

- Accented should work on any web page, so positioning is a challenge (TODO: expand this, add some examples:
  the target can be big or small, it can be a `button`, an `input`, or a `dialog`).
  - The element with issues may have static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky positioning.
    And we have to support all of those scenarios.

## DOM structure

- What we need is to position the trigger button
  - We actually position the overlay that contains the button, for XYZ reasons, but let's focus on just the button for now.
- What options do we have?
  - Add the button inside the element with issues.
    - Downsides:
      - some elements can't have children, e.g. `<img>`, `<input>`, etc.
      - it may affect some of the issues.
  - Add all the buttons in a separate container, and position them absolutely.
    - Downsides:
      - Issues with modal dialogs (see Contributing.md)
      - Focus order issues.
  - Add the button next to the element with issues, as a sibling.
    - This is what we went with, but there's still a positioning challenge.


Maybe don't talk much about DOM placement: just say that we can't put the element inside the element with issues,
and that we want to minimize DOM changes, so we must take any other elements we add out of the normal document flow.

## Fixed and absolute positioning

So if we don't consider anchor positioning, we have two options:
- absolute positioning. We position the element relative to the closest scrollable container.
  - No way to properly position triggers on elements with `position: sticky` (because those exhibit the behaviors of both static and fixed positioning).
- fixed positioning.
  - the `position: sticky` issue is not an issue any longer, but now we need to update the position on scroll.

## How anchor positioning helps

Now with anchor positioning, we can, as the name suggests, anchor the trigger to the element with issues.
TODO: talk in detail about anchor positioning.
Which means that we're free to place the element in the dom wherever we want (including as a sibling of the element with issues),
and the trigger will still be positioned correctly.
- It requires much less code.

## Caveats
- We need to update the value of `anchor-name` on the element with issues.
  We try to be careful and not break any existing styles (for example, we do XYZ),
  but it's hardly possible to be 100% safe.

## Browser support
- Anchor positioning is still not supported in all browsers that Accented supports.
  - It's completely unsupported in Firefox.
  - In Safari, support was added very recently (version 26.0), but the implementation has a bug which prevents all the tests in Accented from passing.
  - In non-supporting browsers, we fall back to fixed positioning with scroll event listener.

## Bonus: logical properties
While not directly related to anchor positioning,
we use logical [CSS logical properties and values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values)
throughout the codebase.
This has a particular benefit: it's RTL support (TODO: add screenshots).

## Closing thoughts.
Anchor positioning is cool, and it's very helpful in some scenarios, but we still can't use it without providing a fallback.
