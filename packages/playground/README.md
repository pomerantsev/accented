# Playground

This app is fully vibe-coded using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/) and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code).

It may be ugly or inefficient. Its main purpose is to work and to be able to showcase how Accented works.

It purposefully contains some accessibility issues that can be detected with Accented.

The playground can be accessed via [https://stackblitz.com/github/pomerantsev/accented/tree/main/packages/playground?title=Accented%20playground%20%28React%20%2B%20TypeScript%29]
(see https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/integration/open-from-github).
