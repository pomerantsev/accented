# Playground

This app is fully vibe-coded using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/)

It purposefully contains some accessibility issues that can be detected with Accented.

The playground can be accessed via [https://stackblitz.com/github/pomerantsev/accented/tree/main/packages/playground?title=Accented%20playground%20%28React%20%2B%20TypeScript%29]
(see https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/integration/open-from-github).
