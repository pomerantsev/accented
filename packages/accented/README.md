# Accented

Accented is a library that helps visually identify accessibility issues in a website or webapp under development.

It can be set up in only a few lines of code

It complements approaches to other means of continuous automated accessibility testing such as static code analysis and inclusion of accessibility tests in test suites. Think of it as a form of linting, but for a rendered web page rather than for source code.

Accented uses the [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) testing engine.
