# Accented

Continuous accessibility testing and issue highlighting for web development.

It can be set up in only a few lines of code

It complements approaches to other means of continuous automated accessibility testing such as static code analysis and inclusion of accessibility tests in test suites. Think of it as a form of linting, but for a rendered web page rather than for source code.

Accented uses the [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) testing engine.

TODO: example screenshots, without Accented / with Accented.
